This typically means suits & ties, tuxedos, or long sleeves and blazers for gentlemen. For the ladies, floor-length or midi-length dresses are recommended. Please note that we are having an outdoor ceremony. We also ask that guests avoid wearing colors reserved for the bride such as cream, ivory, or white. You may check The Details tab for references.",
